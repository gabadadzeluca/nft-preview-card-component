## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex property

### What I learned

I learned using display: flex, justify-content,align-items, wrap properties. I'm able to use display flex now. I understood the difference between inline and inline-block elements.


### Continued development

I wasn't able to add hover function withour using position: absolute. Which I think isn't a best way to add image-overlay.
